# Theme

One global `Theme` holds the mode, the palette every component paints with, and the tokens for size, radius and shadow. Read it with `cx.theme()`; change it through `Theme`'s functions, and every window repaints.

## Read the theme

Bring `ActiveTheme` into scope and call `cx.theme()` on `App`, or on a `Context`, which derefs to `App`.

| Item | Holds |
| --- | --- |
| `colors` | The `Palette`: 36 named colors (`bg`, `surface`, `fg`, `fg_muted`, `accent`, `border`, `focus`, `danger` and the rest), with `chart`, `ansi` and `syntax`. |
| `text_size(TextSize)` | `Xs` 11px to `Display` 32px, times `font_scale`. |
| `radius(Radius)` | `Sm` 4px, `Md` 6px, `Lg` 8px, `Xl` 12px, times `radius_scale`. |
| `elevation(Elevation)` | Shadows for `Raised`, `Floating` and `Modal`; darker in dark mode. |
| `control_height(ControlSize)` | `Sm` 24px, `Md` 28px, `Lg` 32px; 4px less under `Density::Compact`, 4px more under `Comfortable`. |
| `is_dark()`, `high_contrast()`, `color_blind_safe()` | The current switches. |

Sizes come back as `Rems`, so they follow the window's rem size.

## Change the theme

| Call | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `Theme::set_mode(mode, cx)` | Cross-fades the palette to `Mode::Light` or `Mode::Dark`. |
| `Theme::set_mode_now(mode, cx)` | Switches at once. Call it before a window opens to set its first frame. |
| `Theme::set_high_contrast(on, cx)` | Muted text and borders move further from the page, and glass turns opaque, in Ely's palettes. |
| `Theme::set_color_blind_safe(on, cx)` | Chart hues that stay apart under protanopia, deuteranopia and tritanopia. |
| `Theme::set_palette(mode, palette, cx)` | An owner's palette for one mode; `None` brings Ely's back. |
| `Theme::update(cx, edit)` | Edits the other fields: `density`, `font_scale`, `radius_scale`, `font_family`, `mono_family`, `reduced_motion`. |

The color calls log at the `info` level, so a theme change shows in the app's log.

## An owner's palette

`cx.theme().palette()` returns the palette the shown mode fades to. Change a color by its field's name with `token_mut`, then hand the palette back for that mode. A name the palette lacks panics, naming it. High contrast and color-blind safe charts change Ely's own palettes, never an owner's.

## Chart hues

`colors.chart` holds eight hues. `HUE_NAMES` names them in order: Blue, Teal, Ochre, Rose, Violet, Green, Rust, Cyan. `colors.hue(index, owner)` returns one and panics past the eighth, naming `owner`, so an event or a label can wear the same hue a chart does.

## A card made of tokens

The example draws a card from tokens alone, with buttons that turn the mode, the contrast, the density and the accent.
